# kinect-movement-using-ofNode
move and save a kinect location using ofNode

this project uses the ofxCameraSaveLoad addon by Roy Macdonald found here: https://github.com/roymacdonald/ofxCameraSaveLoad

The goal of this project is to visually manipulate a kinect point cloud 
to line up with another kinect pointcloud so one can combine them.

use 's' to save the location and 'l' to load the location.
use the spacebar to freeze the movement of the kinect by zeroing the various sliders.
